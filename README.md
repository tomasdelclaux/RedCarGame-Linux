## Overview

The red car gamme is a simple pixelated game, where the redCar needs to move across five lanes and avoid colliding with the rest of the vehicles. Two lanes are in reverse direction and the cars move twice as fast, and the remainder three lanes are in the direction of the red Car. The score is increased the further the red Car goes.

## Controls

- Left key = moves the red car left
- Right key = moves the red car right
- Up key = red car accelerates and moves faster
